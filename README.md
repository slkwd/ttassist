 The Traditional Tune Archive Companion
 
 I created this project because I needed to interface with the assistant I created on the [OpenAI Assistant platform](https://platform.openai.com/assistants).
 I looked everywhere without finding anything that suited me with the exception of sites that host your **assistantID** for a fee and give you in return four HTML instructions to embed on your site.

 So I asked ChatGPT to create this application for me and he/she did.

 It works--and well!

 The name of the project is The Traditional Tune Archive's Companion because I have taught my Assistant everything there is to know about [The Traditional Tune Archive](https://tunearch.org) (my semantic web dedicated to the traditional music of the British Isles, Ireland, Scotland, North America and Canada) however, I believe it is generic enough to be used by anyone who needs to interface with their pre-trained Assistant.
